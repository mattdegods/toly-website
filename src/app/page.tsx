            $TOLY was born out of a conversation between two friends who have
            been in the Solana ecosystem for a few years now. Around the time, a
            few tokens were launched, but none had fully decentralized
            distribution. As an experiment and a point of curiosity in exploring
            the token program library, the two friends created and launched
            $TOLY. They self-seeded the LP, immediately burned the LP tokens,
            and revoked mint authority.

            <br />
            From the onset, $TOLY was meant for the people to honor the founder
            of Solana,{" "}

              100,000,000 $TOLY was attempted to be burned on [DATE HERE].
              However, the main developer made a mistake and accidentally sent
              it to trash.sol. That led to a short-term sell-off. Today, $TOLY
              is now fully distributed and decentralized with little wallet
              concentration. The founding developers did not and do not hold
              $TOLY.
